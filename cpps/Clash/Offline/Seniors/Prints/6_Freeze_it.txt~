Two magicians Harshit and Varad are competing with each other.
To see who is superior amongst them they are participating in a competition called "Freeze it".
Judge of the competition Abizer decides rules for the competition.
There are N rivers flowing down the mountain.(numbered 1 to N inclusive). Some of these rivers are originating from the glacier and some of these are sub part of another rivers.
If a river x is a sub-river of river y and river z in turn is a sub-river of river y.
Then river z is also a sub-river of river x.

Both the magicians play optimally and alternatively.
Each magician will choose a river and freeze it.
Once a river is freezed all it's sub-rivers are also freezed and they will become glaciers.
And a glacier cannot be freezed again.xD
The one who is unable to freeze a river will lose.

Abizer favours Harshit by always giving him first chance.
