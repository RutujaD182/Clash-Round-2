Ayush is Feeling very bored today so he makes a Simple Game in which he gives an array of size N to Amey and asks him Q queries. In each query Amey is given an integer X. He has to find greatest index where 1<=index<=N satisfying the eqation negSum[index] <= X.
where negSum[i] is a[1]+a[2]+...a[i-1]+a[i+1]+a[i+2]+...a[N]
Help Amey to find answer for each Query

Input:-
	First Line is T denoting no. of test cases
	First line of each test case contains two space seperated integers N and Q denoting no. of elements in array and no. of Queries
	Next line contains N space seperated integers i.e.a[i]
	Next Q line contains single Integer X 
	
Output:-
	For each Query Print answer on new line
	Print "-1" without quotes if not possible.
	
Constraints:-
	1<=T<=10
	1<=N<=100000
	1<=Q<=1000
	1<=a[i],X<=1000000
	
Sample Input:-
	1
	3 1
	1 3 2
	3
	
Sample Output:-
	3
