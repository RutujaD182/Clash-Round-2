							Shivang Loves Graphs


Question:
There are N nodes in a graph having E edges.Shivang needs to find the total number of ways to reach from a node A to node B in exactly K moves.
(For example-To reach node B from  A in exactly 2 moves there has to be a node X in between them such that he can go to node X from A and then to B from X ).
You are given Q queries.Each query contains nodes C and D.Help Shivang to find the total number of ways to reach a node D from C in exactly K moves.


Input:
    • First line contains K denoting the number of moves.
    • Next line contains N denoting the number of nodes.
    • Next line contains E denoting the number of edges.
    • E lines follows input two integer A and B denoting the source and denstination node.
    • Next line contains Q denoting the number of Queries.
    • Q lines follows input two integers C and D denoting source and destination node.


Constraints:
    • 1<=N<=100
    • 1<=K<=70
    • 1<=E<=10*N
    • 1<=Q<=100000
    • 1<=C,D<=N


Output:
    • For each query print a single integer P denoting no of possible ways Shivang can reach D from C.As P may be large output it in modulo 1000000007
