Nayse and Tanmay are best friends.They are sitting in a boring lecture.So they decided to play an interesting game. 
Nayse gave Tanmay 2 arrays each of size N. Let the arrays be A1,A2,...,AN and B1,B2,...,BN. 
He asked him to find number of valid indices i such that Ai != Bi. 

Help Tanmay to complete his task. 


Input: 
First line contains an integer N denoting size of the Arrays. 
Next Line contains N space-seperated integers A1,A2,...,AN .
Next Line contains N space-seperated integers B1,B2,...,BN 


Constraints:  
1 <= N <= 10^6   
1 <= Ai,Bi <= 10^6  


Output: 
Print a single integer containing number of valid indices i such that Ai != Bi .
