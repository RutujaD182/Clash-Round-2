Biyani started studying new topic in maths called as factorial.While solving problems he came up with the problem of finding super function of a number.
super function of a number is sum of total numbers of divisors of divisors of that number.
For example, if n=24 and d(k) denotes total number of divisors of k then,
super(24) = d(1) + d(2) + d(3) + d(4) + d(6) + d(8) + d(12) + d(24) = 1+2+2+3+4+4+6+8 = 30 .
As finding super function of number is very easy.he wonders what is super function of factorial of given number.
As Biyani is very weak in maths help him to find this number.
As the number can be very large find the answer modulo 1000000007.

Input
-First line of input contains T denoting total number of test cases.
-Next lines contain single integer n denoting the number.
