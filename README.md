# Clash-RC-Round-2

Hey, This is to make sure you all have cloned the repo and set git for working with it..

--> These are the steps you need to follow for setting your git with this project's repository..

1) download a zip

2) extract that file..

3) copy and paste the extracted folder in the your environment folder ("myenv" in my case)..

4) go to that directory by command line and then write.
   $ git init

5) $ git add .
   # Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.

6) $ git remote add origin https://github.com/clash-rc-round-2/Clash-RC-Round-2.git
   # Sets the new remote
   $ git remote -v
   # Verifies the new remote URL
   
Bofore making commit append the list below which you can find in downloaded zip as a readme.txt So that I can understand you have completed and set the git by following all 9 steps correctly.
