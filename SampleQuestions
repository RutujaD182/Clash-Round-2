Almost right-angled triangles I-Let us call an integer sided triangle with sides a ≤ b ≤ c barely acute if the sides satisfy a2 + b2 = c2 + 1. How many barely acute triangles are there with perimeter ≤ 25,000,000?
	

The Chase-"The Chase" is a game played with two dice and an even number of players. The players sit around a table; the game begins with two opposite players having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die roll it. If a player rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour on the left; if he rolls a 6, he passes the die to his neighbour on the right; otherwise, he keeps the die for the next turn. The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled and passed; that player has then lost. In a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the game lasts? Give your answer rounded to ten significant digits.


Fibonacci Words-For any two strings of digits, A and B, we define FA,B to be the sequence (A,B,AB,BAB,ABBAB,...) in which each term is the concatenation of the previous two. Further, we define DA,B(n) to be the nth digit in the first term of FA,B that contains at least n digits. Example: Let A=1415926535, B=8979323846. We wish to find DA,B(35), say. The first few terms of FA,B are: 1415926535 8979323846 14159265358979323846 897932384614159265358979323846 14159265358979323846897932384614159265358979323846 Then DA,B(35) is the 35th digit in the fifth term, which is 9. Now we use for A the first 100 digits of π behind the decimal point: 14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510 58209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679 and for B the next hundred digits: 82148086513282306647093844609550582231725359408128 48111745028410270193852110555964462294895493038196 . Find ∑n = 0,1,...,17 10n× DA,B((127+19n)×7n) .


Lattice points on a circle-Let f(N) be the number of points with integer coordinates that are on a circle passing through (0,0), (N,0),(0,N), and (N,N). It can be shown that f(10000) = 36. What is the sum of all positive integers N ≤ 1011 such that f(N) = 420 ?
	

Luxury Hampers-Suppliers 'A' and 'B' provided the following numbers of products for the luxury hamper market: Product 'A' 'B' Beluga Caviar 5248 640 Christmas Cake 1312 1888 Gammon Joint 2624 3776 Vintage Port 5760 3776 Champagne Truffles 3936 5664 Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect condition, there is inevitably some spoilage - i.e. products gone bad. The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic: The five per-product spoilage rates for each supplier are equal to the number of products gone bad divided by the number of products supplied, for each of the five products in turn. The overall spoilage rate for each supplier is equal to the total number of products gone bad divided by the total number of products provided by that supplier. To their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product spoilage rates was worse (higher) for 'B' than for 'A' by the same factor (ratio of spoilage rates), m>1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall spoilage rate was worse


The Race-Two players share an unbiased coin and take it in turns to play "The Race". On Player 1's turn, he tosses the coin once: if it comes up Heads, he scores one point; if it comes up Tails, he scores nothing. On Player 2's turn, she chooses a positive integer T and tosses the coin T times: if it comes up all Heads, she scores 2T-1 points; otherwise, she scores nothing. Player 1 goes first. The winner is the first to 100 or more points. On each turn Player 2 selects the number, T, of coin tosses that maximises the probability of her winning. What is the probability that Player 2 wins? Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form 0.abcdefgh .
